Learning to program n Micropython. The best way I have learned is by using mini snippets like this and piecing them together to make things work.

Wemos ESP8266 Lite;
This script blinks the LED via PWM
PWM Frequency causing the LED to flash on/off
PWM Duty Cycle to adjust the brightness
This created an interesting flash pattern.
